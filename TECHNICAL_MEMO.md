## Solution Architecture

### Core Algorithms Implemented

#### 1. Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)

- **Use Case**: Large-scale problems with multiple local optima
- **Strengths**: Good exploration of solution space
- **Weaknesses**: No guarantee of optimality

#### 3. Simulated Annealing (SA)
- **Approach**: Probabilistic optimization with temperature-based acceptance
- **Complexity**: O(iterations × n × m) where iterations = max iterations, n = appointments, m = resources
- **Use Case**: When good solutions are needed quickly
- **Strengths**: Fast convergence, good for real-time applications
- **Weaknesses**: Sensitive to parameter tuning
